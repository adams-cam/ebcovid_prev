# NIMBLE models


# nimble_prevalance.R - This script contains the NIMBLE model used for primary prevalance analyses for cumulative seroprevalance, self-test seroprevalance within study round, and covid-probably prevalance within round.

# nimble_prevalance_mitigation.R - This script contains the NIMBLE model used to estiamte assocaition between: 
  # seroprevalence ~ high-risk vs. low-risk mitigation variable
  # self-test prevalence ~ high-risk vs. low-risk mitigation variable
  
# nimble_prevalence_test_bias.R - This script contains the NIMBLE models used to estimate cumulative seroprevlance adjusted for sensitivty and specificity of the seroprevalence assays.
  # Round 1 
  # Round 1+2
  # ROund 1+2+3 (natural infection)
  # Round 1+2+3 (natural infection or vaccination)
